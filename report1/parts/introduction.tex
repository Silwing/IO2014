\section{Introduction}

In this report we describe our implementation, experiments and results we have achieved during project 1 for I/O algorithms 2014.
As reading and writing to and from the disk is estimated at ${10^{6}}$ times slower than using RAM or the CPU cache, creating efficient I/O algorithms can mean the difference between getting a result within a reasonable time-frame and not. 
The usual memory model is made with a very small fast and local memory near CPU, a larger RAM, and finally the disk. Each level that is further away from the CPU becomes slower by a large factor. In our experiments and calculations we are only interested in calculating and experimenting with the time of the I/O operations. An I/O operation is defined by either a read from the disk to main memory or write from the main memory to the disk.
