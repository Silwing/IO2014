\section{External Merge-sort}
The external merge sort has two phases \textit{split} and \textit{merge}. The splitting phase reads \textit{m} elements from the input, sorts the elements and write them to an output stream and continues until the input stream is empty. The merging phase opens \textit{d} input streams and use the d-way-merge to merge those streams into a new stream which is added to the list of input streams. When the remaining number of streams is less than \textit{d} the result is written to the final output stream and the sorting is done.
