\section{Conclusion}
As mentioned in the experiments section our initial results were more or less opposite of the what we had expected. By including an optimization flag (specifically "-O3") for the clang compiler our results showed to be more as expected. We have not found a explanation for this.
After compiler optimizations our results are as expected and we managed to run several tests to find the optimal parameters for external merge sorting and compare them against in-memory quicksort and heapsort. Ultimately we have shown that external merge sort with low ram, and a comparable high amount of data is quite fast when the correct parameters are chosen. For example with 1 mb of RAM sorting 64 mb data can be done in roughly 20 seconds.

As all our tests were carried out with only 1 mb RAM it would be relevant to test how changing this affects the different variables, if at all.
