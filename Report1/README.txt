master-report.tex uses the thesis template from Anders MÃ¸ller
use "make report" to compile

master-article.tex uses an IEEE template instead (looks like a research article)
use "make article" to compile

The contents of the generated PDFs should be identical, as they both
use the contents from the "parts" subfolder.
